# Synthetic data

## Synthetic images

The `SyntheticImage` class enables the creation of images containing simple geometric shapes.

### Creating a synthetic image

To create an empty image, load the `SyntheticImage` class and specify the desired image shape in order (x, y, z), e.g.

```
from skrt.simulation import SyntheticImage

sim = SyntheticImage((250, 250, 50))
```

The following arguments can be used to adjust the image's properties:
- `voxel_size`: voxel sizes in mm in order (x, y, z); default (1, 1, 1).
- `origin`: position of the top-left voxel in mm; default (0, 0, 0).
- `intensity`: value of the background voxels of the image.
- `noise_std`: standard deviation of Gaussian noise to apply to the image. This noise will also be added on top of any shapes. (Can be changed later by altering the `sim.noise_std` property).

#### Adding shapes

The `SyntheticImage` object has various methods for adding geometric shapes. Each shape has the following arguments:
- `intensity`: intensity value with which to fill the voxels of this shape.
- `above`: if `True`, this shape will be overlaid on top of all existing shapes; otherwise, it will be added below all other shapes.

The available shapes and their specific arguments are:
- **Sphere**: `sim.add_sphere(radius, centre=None)`
    - `radius`: radius of the sphere in mm.
    - `centre`: position of the centre of the sphere in mm (if `None`, the sphere will be placed in the centre of the image).
- **Cuboid**: `sim.add_cuboid(side_length, centre=None)`
    - `side_length`: side length in mm. Can either be a single value (to create a cube) or a list of the (x, y, z) side lengths.
    - `centre`: position of the centre of the cuboid in mm (if `None`, the cuboid will be placed in the centre of the image).
- **Cube**: `sim.add_cube(side_length, centre=None)`
    - Same as `add_cuboid`.
- **Cylinder**: `sim.add_cylinder(radius, length, axis='z', centre=None)`
    - `radius`: radius of the cylinder in mm.
    - `length`: length of the cylinder in mm.
    - `axis`: either `'x'`, `'y'`, or `'z'`; direction along which the length of the cylinder should lie.
    - `centre`: position of the centre of the cylinder in mm (if `None`, the cylinder will be placed in the centre of the image).
- **Grid**: `sim.add_grid(spacing, thickness=1, axis=None)`
    - `spacing`: grid spacing in mm. Can either be a single value, or list of (x, y, z) spacings.
    - `thickenss`: gridline thickness in mm. Can either be a single value, or list of (x, y, z) thicknesses.
    - `axis`: if None, gridlines will be created in all three directions; if set to `'x'`, `'y'`, or `'z'`, grids will only be created in the plane orthogonal to the chosen axis, such that a solid grid runs through the image along that axis.

To remove all shapes from the image, run
```
sim.reset()
```

#### Plotting

The `SyntheticImage` class inherits from the `Image` class, and can thus be plotted in the same way by calling

```
sim.plot()
```

along with any of the arguments available to the `Image` plotting method.

#### Rotations and translations

Rotations and translations can be applied to the image using:

```
sim.translate(dx, dy, dz)
```

or 
```
sim.rotate(pitch, yaw, roll)
```

Rotations and translations can be removed by running
```
sim.reset_transforms()
```

#### Getting the image array

To obtain a NumPy array containing the image data, run
```
array = sim.get_data()
```

This array will contain all of the added shapes, as well as having any rotations, translations, and noise applied.

#### Saving

The synthetic image can be written to an image file by running
```
sim.write(outname)
```

The output name `outname` can be:
- A path ending in `.nii` or `.nii.gz`: image will be written to a nifti file.
- A path ending in `.npy`: image will be written to a binary NumPy file.
- A path to a directory: image will be written to dicom files (one file per slice) inside the directory.

The `write` function can also take any of the arguments of the `Image.write()` function.


### Adding structures

When shapes are added to the image, they can also be set as ROIs. This allows you to:
- Plot them as contours or masks on top of the image;
- Access a `StructureSet` object containing the ROIs;
- Write ROIs out separately as masks or as a dicom structure set file.

#### Single ROIs

To assign a shape as an ROI, you can either give it a name upon creation, e.g.:

```
sim.add_sphere(50, name='my_sphere')
```

or set the `is_roi` property to `True` (the ROI will then be given an automatic named based on its shape type):
```
sim.add_sphere(50, is_roi=True)
```

When `sim.plot()` is called, its ROIs will automatically be plotted as contours. Some useful extra options to the `plot` function are:
- `roi_plot_type`: set plot type to any of the valid `ROI` plotting types (mask, contour, filled, centroid, filled centroid).
- `centre_on_roi`: name of ROI on which the plotted image should be centred.
- `roi_legend`: set to `True` to draw a legend containing the strutcure names.

#### Grouped shapes

Multiple shapes can be combined to create a single ROI. To do this, set the `group` argument to some string when creating shapes. Any shapes created with the same `group` name will be added to this group.

E.g. to create a single ROI called "two_cubes" out of two cubes centred at different positions, run:
```
sim.add_cube(10, centre=(5, 5, 5), group='two_cubes')
sim.add_cube(10, centre=(7, 7, 5)), group='two_cubes')
```

#### Getting ROIs

To get a `StructureSet` object containing all of the ROIs belonging to the image, run:
```
structure_set = sim.get_structure_set()
```

You can also access a single ROI as an `ROI` object by running:
```
roi = sim.get_roi(name)
```

#### Saving ROIs

When the `SyntheticImage.write()` function is called, the ROIs belonging to that image will also be written. If the provided `outname` is that of a nifti or NumPy file, the ROIs will be written to nifti or Numpy files, respectively, inside a directory with the same name as `outname` but with the extension removed.

## Synthetic Patient objects

The Patient class can be used to create a custom patient object from scratch, rather than loading a prexisting patient.

To do this, first create a blank Patient object with your chosen ID:
```
from skrt import Patient

p = Patient("my_id")
```

Studies can then be added to this object. Optional arguments for adding a study are:
- `subdir`: a custom subdirectory in which the study will be nested when the Patient tree is written;
- `timestamp`: a custom timestamp (if not set, this will be automatically generated)
- `images`: a list of Image objects to associate with this study (note, Images can also be added to the Study later)
- `image_type`: the type of image correspoding to the Images in `images`, if used (e.g. `CT`); this will determine the name of the directory in which the images are saved when the Patient tree is written.

E.g. to add one study containing a single synthetic image with one ROI:
```
from skrt.simulation import SyntheticImage

im = SyntheticImage((100, 100, 30))
im.add_sphere(radius=10, name="my_sphere")

p.add_study("my_study", images=[im], image_type="MR")
```

The patient tree can then be written out:
```
p.write(outdir="some_dir")
```

This will create a patient directory `somedir/my_id` containing the added study and its corresponding image and structure set.
